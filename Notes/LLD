I researched for 3 days to collect 42 LLD (Low-Level Design) problems often asked in Interviews.

If you practice them well, you can answer most questions that may come your way.

Points to note for LLD Interviews:
-Show them your OOPS skills
-Show them your analysis skills
-There is no complete solution to problems
-Be ready to tell them the logic behind your decisions

Here are the questions:
